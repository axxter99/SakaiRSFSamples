This project was generated by Sakai App Builder -AZ
To use this project, you should copy this entire folder and all the files into your sakai source directory. If you do not know what that is you may want to check this website out:
	http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/BOOT

Now that you have copied this over to your sakai source directory (or maybe it was already there), you should run the following command to download all the dependencies using maven and compile the code:
	maven bld

Now you can import the project into eclipse (using the current location) or continue using it in eclipse if you created it in your sakai source tree.
